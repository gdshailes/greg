# To Do List

* Tests! Write the tests that you should've written at the outset!
* Sort out markdown previews on diary pages
* Finances: 
  - Handle transfers better: merge with the 'new transaction' page, just add a drop-down for 'transfer to'
  - Add checkbox to transactions view, so you can mark multiple transactions as reconciled without having to edit each one
* Nicer styling for 'Log in' page
* Change non-logged-in homepage to allow visitors to access
  - Make A Decision
  - Verify The Pie
